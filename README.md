## üöÄ Projects Overview

### Manual Testing
- Developed comprehensive test cases covering functional, regression, and exploratory testing.
- Logged and tracked defects using standard bug lifecycle and reporting tools.

### Automation Testing
- Built Selenium WebDriver test frameworks in Java using TestNG and Page Object Model (POM).
- Integrated Behavior Driven Development (BDD) approach using Cucumber.
- Executed automated test suites with continuous integration (CI) tools.

### API Testing
- Automated REST API validations using Postman and Newman CLI.
- Verified API responses, status codes, and payload integrity.

### Performance Testing
- Created and executed JMeter scripts for load and stress testing.
- Analyzed performance metrics and identified bottlenecks.

### Monitoring & Observability
- Configured Prometheus to collect application metrics.
- Designed and imported Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring.
- Set up alerting rules for proactive issue detection.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. Browse manual test cases and defect reports in the `manual-testing` folder.
2. Import Selenium automation projects into your IDE (Eclipse/IntelliJ) and run TestNG suites.
3. Import Postman collections and run API tests locally or via Newman CLI.
4. Open and execute JMeter `.jmx` test plans to analyze performance.
5. Deploy Prometheus using provided configuration files and import Grafana dashboards for visualization.
